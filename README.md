# openstack_liberty_install_generic
Very simple script to install openstack liberty on ubuntu 14.04. This script automates the official Openstack liberty installation guide found here: http://docs.openstack.org/liberty/install-guide-ubuntu/. 

I use this to install a very generic version of openstack liberty on a fresh ubuntu instance.
